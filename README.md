# Hospital-database-project
A group project built on turbo c++ ide, using the C++ programming language. The program can do basic input and output operations and can store records of patients, displaying their diagnosis, along with available doctors available.

Also since this was on an older version of c++, most headers and statements would be invalid, so thats why it's hard to compile on newer IDE's.
